		"description": "Violence alarm / location sharing app",
		"date":"July 8th, 2024",
		"intro": "PartnerSOS empowers users to share their location with their partners instantly when they feel unsafe. Unlike apps like Messenger or Snapchat, PartnerSOS requires only a single tap, ensuring a quick and efficient notification process. Upon activation, the partner receives an SMS containing a link to view the user's location via a web app. The location updates in real-time and can be accessed directly in Google Maps for precise navigation. This streamlined approach ensures that users can seek assistance quickly and effortlessly, especially in stressful situations.",
		"inspirationHeader": "Inspiration",
		"inspiration": "The idea for PartnerSOS stemmed from a personal experience involving a friend. This friend was walking home after work when they noticed a customer following them. While not feeling threatened enough to call the police, they wanted their partner to be aware of their situation immediately. This incident highlighted the need for a simple yet effective way to share one's location, even if cellular data is turned off.",
		"developmentHeader": "Development",
		"development": "As a developer, I recognized the potential to create a fast and reliable solution. PartnerSOS is built using Expo Go and Firebase.",
		"expoGoDetails": "A React Native framework that accelerates app development by providing robust developer tools.",
		"firebaseDetails": "A suite of cloud-based development tools that aid in building, deploying, and scaling mobile apps. I utilized Firebase Authentication, Firestore DB, and Cloud Functions.",
		"experienceHeader": "Experience",
		"experience": "Developing PartnerSOS was a rewarding endeavor, especially since my background is primarily in web development. Leveraging React Native allowed me to apply my web development skills (JSX, TSX) to create a mobile app. Regardless of its popularity, this project provided invaluable experience in mobile app development."

		"intro": "Applitrack is a webapp i made to track the job applications i have sent.",
		"story": "I created this tool because i used to have a spreadsheet in Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. I kept switching between them and often forgot which one was the most recent. So i created Applitrack to see all the applications i had sent, the status of them. I also wanted to be able to see statistics on how many applications i had sent, how many i had gotten a response from and how many i had gotten an interview from.",
		"experience": {
			"title": "My Experience",
			"v1": "In the first version of the application, I used Next.js and Pocketbase. Pocketbase, a lightweight alternative to Supabase with built-in authentication and an SQLite database, combined with Next.js, a powerful JavaScript framework, made development efficient. Next.js's built-in features for routing, image optimization, and static HTML generation contributed to a productive workflow. However, I decided to challenge myself by rewriting the application without Next.js.",
			"v2": "In version 2, I chose a stack consisting of Vite, React, TanStack Query/Router, Pocketbase, Hono.js, and Cloudflare Workers. This gave me valuable experience in developing modular applications without a comprehensive framework.",
			"pros": {
				"title": "Advantages of This Stack",
				"routing-state": "Flexible routing and state management: TanStack Router and Zustand provided full control over the architecture and state management.",
				"performance": "Powerful API with Cloudflare Workers: Using Cloudflare Workers and Hono.js, I was able to create an API for CRUD and authentication features. This resulted in reduced latency and improved global performance.",
				"learning": "Learning and exploration: The transition was a valuable process that expanded my understanding of modern web technologies."

		"intro3": "Upon learning that she would soon graduate and had been showcasing her art exclusively on Instagram, I recognized the need for a more professional platform—an exclusive website.",
		"intro4": "I reached out to Sara and presented an offer she couldn't refuse. I had the freedom to use any technologies I preferred, with her only requirement being a design that is minimal, mobile-friendly, and cost-effective to host.",
		"criteria": "With these criteria in mind, I set out to find a suitable tech stack. I instantly thought of using a CMS such as Wordpress or Squarespace for their ease of use and are easy to maintain. While CMS-platforms like WordPress or Squarespace are popular for their user friendlyness, they come at a literal cost. Luckily there are more cost effective alternatives. Given the nature of the site, all off the content could be static and only need to be updated when she makes a new post. Here is where static site generators(SSG) and headless-CMS systems come in. By utilizing SSGs, such as Next.js, to fetch content from the headless CMS, in this case, Contentful, I could generate a static webpage. This approach is ideal for achieving a custom UI design and allows for easy hosting on Vercel, free of charge. It also enables non-coders to create content through a user-friendly CMS interface, triggering automatic webpage rebuilding via webhooks.",
		"choice": "This choice comes with a drawback—changing the UI in the future would either require coding knowledge or hiring my services again. After discussing the pros and cons, Sara and I agreed on the headless CMS approach.",
